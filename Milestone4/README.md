### Pricing Tier Logic
The pricing tiers are structured by correlating Room_Category revenue with Seasonal Occupancy trends to maximize yield.

**Tier 1: Economy (Standard): This tier focuses on volume, as Standard rooms currently generate the bulk of room-category revenue.**

**Tier 2: Mid-Tier (Deluxe): Logic is applied to increase Deluxe occupancy, which currently shows a revenue gap compared to Standard rooms.**

**Tier 3: Peak/Demand-Based: Rates are adjusted upward when occupancy levels exceed the average of 680 to capitalize on high-demand periods.**

### Upsell Strategy Identification
The approach identifies revenue "leaks" by analyzing the Upsell Score and Upsell Category.

**Conversion Focus: Since 100% of current bookings are classified in the "Low" upsell category, there is an immediate opportunity to move guests into higher-margin services.**

**High ADR Targeting: The strategy uses the "High ADR" filter to identify guests with higher spending power for personalized premium service offers.**

**Ancillary Growth: By targeting an improvement in the "Sum of Upsell Score" (currently 52), the hotel can increase the "TotalRevenuePerGuest" beyond the current 9M.**

### Seasonal Promotion Insights
Promotional activities are tailored to the Sum of Occupancy by Season chart to balance the load throughout the year.

**Spring/Summer: With occupancy reaching peak levels (60K+), promotions shift from discounts to "Premium Experience" packages to protect the RevPAR of 101.12.**

**Winter: Data shows a stable but lower occupancy trend; promotions here should target the "Booking_Channel" with the highest volume to fill remaining capacity.**

### Key Revenue Improvement Recommendations
**Branch Standardization: Address the volatility in the "Sum of Revenue by Hotel_Branch" by applying the pricing logic of the highest-performing branch to underperforming locations.**

**RevPAR Optimization: Focus on increasing the "First RevPAR" (101.12) by aggressively upselling the "Deluxe" room category.**

**Segment Diversification: Use the "High ADR" and "Low ADR" toggles to create specific marketing campaigns that cater to different price sensitivities.**
